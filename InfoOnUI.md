1. The Discrepancy UI DesignThe UI is built on a "Conflict-Resolution" card system. Instead of a spreadsheet, it presents the manager with a series of "Decision Cards."Key Components of the Screen:The Conflict Stack: A sidebar showing "High Priority" (Price/Stock mismatches) vs. "Low Priority" (Duplicate customer profiles).The "Side-by-Side" Comparison: * Terminal A Record: "Sold 1x Gengar (Holo) at 2:15 PM."Terminal B Record: "Marked 1x Gengar (Holo) as 'Missing' at 2:20 PM."Action Buttons: Large, color-coded buttons: [Keep Terminal A], [Keep Terminal B], or [Manual Adjustment].2. The Logic: "The Reconciliation Engine"When the local devices sync, the system runs a three-way check:Expected Stock: What the database thought was there.Reported Sales: What the terminals say happened.Physical Delta: If (Expected - Sales) < 0, a Stock Deficit Alert is triggered.Example Scenario:Item: Lorcana: Elsa - Spirit of Winter (Enchanted) > Initial Stock: 1Offline Event: Clerk A sells it to a walk-in. Clerk B (offline in the backroom) sells it to a caller over the phone.Reconciliation: The system flags a "Double Sale" conflict. The manager is prompted to see which transaction happened first and who needs a refund.3. The "Manager's Audit" Database TableTo support this UI, we add a specific table to the schema to track these "Ghosts":ColumnTypeDescriptionconflict_uuidUUIDUnique ID for the error.affected_skuUUIDLink to the card in question.conflict_typeEnum[Oversold, Price_Mismatch, Credit_Anomaly].terminal_idsArrayWhich devices were involved in the conflict.resolution_statusBooleanHas a manager fixed this yet?4. Feature: The "Blind Count" Inventory AuditTo prevent "shrinkage" (theft), VaultSync includes a blind audit mode.The Manager triggers a "Blind Count" for the High Value Case.The Clerk must scan every card in the case without seeing what the system thinks is there.VaultSync compares the scan to the database and generates a Discrepancy Report only for the items that don't match.Benefit: The clerk can't just hit "Confirm All" to hide a missing card.5. Security GuardrailsThe Paper Trail: Every time a discrepancy is "resolved," the system creates a permanent, non-editable log entry: "Manager [Name] overridden Stock Deficit for SKU-102. Reason: Physical miscount."Remote Alerts: If the shop is part of a franchise, the owner receives a push notification if a discrepancy exceeds a certain dollar value (e.g., >$100 discrepancy).
